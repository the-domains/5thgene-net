While situating myself in a coffee house in mid-town Long Beach a something hip and ceremoniously casual local joint called Portfolio.  I'm sharing couch and table space with a youthful young man clad head to toe in black.  He's arched and bent over some notebooks and a paper stuffed novel.  Our harmony is accosted by a young woman and her mother.  They proclaim to hate people.

"I'm sure _The People_ are not offended," I dryly chime into their conversation, simultaneously sliding over and switching the orange pillow to the opposite side.  A moments hesitation leads to them both resting on the empty space I've left.  

Throughout the mother-daughter visit and banter, the young man coyly looks up from his concentration into the daughters eyes.  The look is returned.

I sip my coffee and indulge in this small interaction.
